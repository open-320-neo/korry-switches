# Korry Buttons

To really get the feeling of being in a cockpit, realistic buttons are important. They have to look and work like real airplane buttons. The buttons most used in aircraft are Korry buttons, so we replicate them here for flight sims.

We are not affiliated with Korry, nor do we recommend using this DIY product for real aircraft. For all real aircraft engineering, please go to Korry and use their buttons.

## Dimensions

The dimensions were copied from the Korry datasheet and converted to metric units.

## Pins

Every button has a connection with 4 pins: GND, Signal, LED1, and LED2.

## Lenses

The buttons have backlit lenses, on which text becomes visible based on an LED.
