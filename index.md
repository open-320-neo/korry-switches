# Korry Switches

To really get the feelin of beein in a Cockpit, realistic buttons are important. We strived to make them go easy on your 3D Printer and in a modular fashion.

## Dimensions

The dimensions are directly copied from the official Korry datasheet, and converted to frienly looking metric values.


## Lenses

For the Lenses we use a Lasercutter and acryllic Glass.
